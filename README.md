# PHP-Guestbook

## Mission
create a guestbook that displays the last 20 messages and sorts them from new(top) to old(bottom).
use classes and different files and implement these with require. Store the messages in a seperate file.

## Must-haves
- Post class with following attributes
  - Title
  - Date
  - Content
  - Author name

- Use at least 2 classes: PostLoader & Post

- The messages are sorted from new (top) to old (bottom).

- Make sure the script can handle site defacement attacks: use htmlspecialchars()

- Only show the latest 20 posts.

### Nice-to-haves
- Profanity filter: at the top of your script create an array of "bad" words. If somebody tries to enter a message with those words, their messages gets rejected.

- When the user enters uses a "smily" like ":-)", ";-)", ":-(" replace it with an image of such a smily.

- Have an input field where the user can enter how many message he wants to see displayed.
